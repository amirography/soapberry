== Context
// statement of problem
How should we structure different crates related to the soapberry project?


== Decision drivers
// items and forces that are considered in this decision
* Ease of change
* Reliability of API
* Complexity of maintenance


== Decision
// what is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
{decision}

== Considered Alternatives
// alternatives routes we could have taken, why we did not
* one repo for soapberry and submodules for each crate
** using submodules will create complexity when updating versions
** also this will not help with immediate feedback

* one repo per crate
** this item will cause a huge amount of friction when one crate updates.
** also this will cause a headache for maintenance of CI/CD, considering that each change needs to be replicated on all crates.



== Consequences
// What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
Pros::
* Increases the agility.
Cons::
* History of repose that I have already created will be lost.
